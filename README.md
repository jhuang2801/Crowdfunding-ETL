# Crowdfunding-ETL
## Objective
- The objective of this module is to practice and apply ETL, which stands for "Extract, Transform, and Load". First, the data (in backer_info.csv) contains only one column with all the information. The information is then subsequently sliced up and extracted into readable information (backer_id, cf_id, first_name, last_name, and email) into appropriate columns. The retrieved information is then stored and exported as a new file called "backers.csv". Next, in order to relate this newly created table "backers" to the previous tables in crowdfunding analysis, SQL is applied to draw relationships between all tables. The new "backers" table has "backer_id" as its primary key, and "cf_id" is the foreign key that connects it to the campaign table (which was previously created). The relationship of all tables is summarized in a diagram saved in  crowdfunding_db_relationships.png.
